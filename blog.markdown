## Welcome to meltham.digital
A website which was born from the off chance that I got a free domain for a year. Stay a while, or understandably do not.
Ideas:
* Personal music portfolio
* Music album review webpage
* Whatever else comes to mind between now and then


To do:

* Work on HTML
* Jekyll design
* Make good website.
